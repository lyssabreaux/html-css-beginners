            <h3>Preparation</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Soak frog legs in beer for an hour or so.</li>
                <li>Season: I used our Duck Commander’s Zesty Cajun seasoning, pepper, and blackening seasoning.</li> 
                <li>Roll frog legs in flour, then set aside.</li>
                <li>In a large black skillet, bring butter and grapeseed oil up to high 
                    (don’t burn the butter; it will brown when burning) — not much oil and butter, just enough to brown.If butter 
                    gets low, throw another half stick in.</li>
                <li>When oil and butter start sizzling, working in batches if necessary, brown frog legs on both sides; be careful, they splatter.</li>
                <li>Set browned frog legs to side. Now, with what’s left in the pan (which is the best of, what’s left), add white wine, garlic (whole pods, peeled), and mushrooms, and cook for a few minutes.</li> 
                <li>Add all your frog legs back in on top of this, put lid on, and cook in oven for about 30 minutes at 300ºF, according to how big the legs are (these tonight were huge) so they didn’t cook fully in the browning process. 
                    If they are small, then cook less.</li>
                <li>Meat will be falling off the bone. You will know it’s done—believe me!</li>
                <li>Serve!</li>
